A small, personal to-do application built with Flutter.

This app was created primarily for my girlfriend to keep track of what she needs to do and when she needs to do it during college. I plan to maintain this project for as long as she is in college and actively using it.

This is not a commercial product, not a startup idea, and not a polished productivity app. It is a simple, honest utility built quickly to solve a real, personal problem.

---

## About the Project

- Built in **one night (approximately 3-4 hours),**, hence certainly NOT polished
- Focused on simplicity and reliability
- Local-first, no account or cloud dependency
- Designed to be easy to extend later

Because of the short build time, the app is **not fully furnished** and intentionally avoids over-engineering.

---

## Current Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Optional date and time for tasks
- Priority levels (Low / Medium / High)
- Mark tasks as completed
- Completed tasks are removed from the main list but stored separately
- Clean and minimal UI
- Fully offline
- Local data persistence

---

## Known Limitations

The following features are present in the UI but **do not work yet** and will be implemented later:

- [x] Notifications / reminders
- [ ] Tags page and tag-based filtering


Everything else in the app works as intended.

---

## Required Permissions

- Set Exact Alarms(Android 13+)
- Allow notifications

---


## Tech Stack

- Flutter
- Localized Notifications(since I'm based in Kolkata, India, this project contains traces of localization defaults to that)
- Local storage (Hive)

No backend, no authentication, no cloud sync.

---

## Project Status

This project is actively maintained but intentionally kept simple.

Updates will be made:
- When lethal bugs are found
- When my girlfriend needs new features
- When there is free time to improve stability or UX

There is no fixed roadmap or release schedule.

## Build Notes

- This app was built quickly as a functional prototype
- Code prioritizes clarity over abstraction

- Not optimized for scale or large datasets
